# Mindmatch_website

based on an academic research that differentiate mental health preferences in 8 categories. we tried to create a website that provide customized questionaries guiding him in highlighting the most important mental aspects for, so he can be able to choose a company that fit his needs.
in our days, job search process focused more on job task and doesn't give any insights about the users work environment and colleagues, so we tried to shorten the gap by introducing "Mindmatch" that give the user the ability to do some questionnaires that can output some insights about his preferences in mental health.
we build our questionnaire with a chain of prompt engineering to try to create MCQ questions "rank based questions".
then we create a visualized dashboard that summarized his answer' results and finally the solution provide a unique chatbot experience where the user can talk with dedicated chatbot "RAG system", that is build on companies reviews and historical data, so the website provide him with some recommendations that narrow his search and help him to make the best solution
